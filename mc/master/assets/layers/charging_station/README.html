<h1 id="the-charging-station-theme">The charging station theme</h1><p>As you might have noticed, the charging station theme is complicated and large.</p><p>There are a ton of repititive questions. Luckily, we can generate those.</p><p>If you want to add a missing socket type, then:</p><ul> <li>Add all the properties in &#39;types.csv&#39;</li> <li>Add an icon. (Note: icons are way better as pictures as they are perceived more abstractly)</li> <li>Update license_info.json with the copyright info of the new icon. Note that we strive to have Creative-commons icons only (though there are exceptions)</li> </ul><p>AT this point, most of the work should be done; feel free to send a PR. If you would like to test it locally first ( which is recommended) and have a working dev environment, then run:</p><ul> <li>Run &#39;ts-node csvToJson.ts&#39; which will generate a new charging_station.json based on the protojson</li> <li>Run<code>npm run query:licenses</code> to get an interactive program to add the license of your artwork, followed by <code>npm run generate:licenses</code></li> <li>Run <code>npm run generate:layeroverview</code> to generate the layer files</li> <li>Run <code>npm run start</code> to run the instance</li> </ul><h2 id="the-csv-file">The CSV File</h2><p>The columns in the CSV file are:</p><ul> <li><code>key</code>: the key as described on the wiki, starts with <code>socket:</code></li> <li><code>image</code>: The associated image (a .svg)</li> <li><code>description:en</code> A description in english</li> <li><code>description:nl</code> A description in english</li> <li><code>countryWhiteList</code>: Only show this plug type in these countries</li> <li><code>countryBlackList</code>: Don&#39;t show this plug type in these countries. NOt compatibel with the whiteList</li> <li><code>commonVoltages</code>, <code>commonCurrents</code>, <code>commonOutputs</code>: common values for these tags</li> <li><code>associatedVehicleTypes</code> and <code>neverAssociatedWith</code>: these work in tandem to hide options. If every associated vehicle type is <code>no</code>, then the option is hidden If at least one <code>neverAssociatedVehicleType</code> is <code>yes</code> and none of the associated types is yes, then the option is hidden too</li> <li><code>extraVisualisationCondition</code>: in some exceptional cases, a socket type is branded differently. This extra condition allows tho hide these cases in the big multi-answer</li> </ul>
