The streets, buildings, ... come from OpenStreetMap which got linked with Wikidata. In the popup, you'll see the Wikipedia article (if it exists) or a wikidata box of what the object is named after. If the object itself has a wikipedia page, that'll be shown too.<br/><br/><b>You can help contribute too!</b>Zoom in enough and <i>all</i> streets will show up. You can click one and a Wikidata-search box will popup. With a few clicks, you can add an etymology link. Note that you need a free OpenStreetMap account to do this.","orientation":"portrait-primary, landscape-primary","icons":[{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo72.png","sizes":"72x72","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo96.png","sizes":"96x96","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo120.png","sizes":"120x120","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo128.png","sizes":"128x128","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo144.png","sizes":"144x144","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo152.png","sizes":"152x152","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo180.png","sizes":"180x180","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo192.png","sizes":"192x192","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo384.png","sizes":"384x384","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/generated/layers_etymology_logo512.png","sizes":"512x512","type":"image/png"},{"src":"assets/layers/etymology/logo.svg","sizes":"513x513","type":"image/svg"}]}
