<p>This is a theme for mapping cycle node networks. The intention is to make it easy to map the cycle nodes itself while riding the bike and then continue mapping at home and add the routes itself and connecting the nodes.</p><p>This theme is based on a version first developed by Seppe Santes here: <a href="https://github.com/seppesantens/MapComplete-Themes/blob/main/cyclenodenetworks/cyclenodenetworks.json">https://github.com/seppesantens/MapComplete-Themes/blob/main/cyclenodenetworks/cyclenodenetworks.json</a></p><p>A description on how to map cycle node networks in OSM can be found <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_Node_Network_Tagging">on the OSM wiki</a>.</p>
